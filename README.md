- 👋 Hi, I’m @dshuman52
- 👀 I’m interested in Configuration Management via Bash Scripting
      Primarily on Raspberry Pi's using Ubuntu, Manjaro, Arch Linux and FreeBSD with Root on ZFS.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about Bash Scripting
I am a retired programmer that dates back to pre-PC days and have worked on mainframes and mini's too.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
                        the freeBSD, Arch and Manjaro configurations for Root on ZFS 
                                after I get the Ubuntu version working.
                         Non Root on ZFS configurations for Raspian and others should not
                                be difficult based on my process.
